# 🚀 FastAPI for Data Science & AI Projects

Welcome to my FastAPI learning repository! This repo is dedicated to my journey of mastering **FastAPI** in the context of **Data Science**, **Generative AI**, and **Chatbot Development**.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework that enables efficient development of APIs with Python, making it an ideal choice for serving machine learning models and building AI-powered applications.
